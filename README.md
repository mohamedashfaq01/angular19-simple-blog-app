# Created small blog application using the angular 18 features and dummy json api.

The application will:
1. Fetch posts from DummyJSON  API
2. Display them in a list with truncate pipe
3. Allow navigation to individual post details
4. Show loading states and error messages
5. Use Angular Signals for reactive state management
6. Utilize the new control flow syntax
7. Follow standalone component architecture
8. Added pagination.
9. Added reaction count


The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200` and you can:
- View all posts
- Click on posts to see detailed view
- Navigate back to the list
- See loading states during API calls
- Handle errors appropriately

I have deployed this working demo in vercel.
